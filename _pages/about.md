üëã Hey there! I'm a PhD candidate studying the dynamics of the Antarctic Ice Sheets over the past 1.4 million years using Ice-Rafted Debris (IRD) from deep-sea sediment cores. I use a combination of machine learning, radiogenic isotopic analysis, and iceberg trajectory modeling to understand past Antarctic ice-sheet behavior.

I'm particularly interested in:
* IRD flux variability across the mid-Pleistocene transition
* Provenance studies using Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopes
* Reconstructing iceberg trajectories to better understand past ocean circulation patterns

My samples come from IODP Expedition 383 ‚Äì [Dynamics of the Pacific Antarctic Circumpolar Current (DYNAPACC)](http://publications.iodp.org/proceedings/383/383title.html), an international research cruise that targeted sediment cores across the Central South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean to investigate the role of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) in global climate evolution. The expedition recovered high-resolution sediment cores that are ideal for reconstructing past atmosphere-ocean dynamics of ACC and Antarctic ice sheet dynamics across key climate transitions such as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition.

You can usually find me coding in Python (mostly in Jupyter Lab), working with deep-sea sediment cores, or building visualizations of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica.

Outside the lab, I'm always down for food adventures and the occasional dive into a good brewery.
